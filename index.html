                    <p>Where to start from. I can write millions of pages about Juno, oh no, I am not sponsored by Juno, I just believe so much in this project and I know that it has a big future ahead :)</p>
                    <p>Origins - The idea behind Juno. Juno started as a community initiative. From the very beginning, every single parameter of the chain has been shaped and configured to prioritize the community and individual holders as the primary focus of the network. Unlike many other blockchains, we decided to go the hard way - taking no money from VCs and implementing a token distribution heavily in favor of the individuals supporting the project.</p>
                    <p>The genesis allocation was as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>47.24% Liquid airdrop to ATOM stakers</li>
                        <li>30.82% Community Pool</li>
                        <li>15.54% Treasury (the multisig mentioned in my intro)</li>
                        <li>3.66% Hack Juno - A development competition we held pre-launch</li>
                        <li>2.74% Core 1 Individuals - This percentage is split among the first five multisig members as private allocations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The objective of the network was simply to become one of the major Cross-Chain Smart Contract platforms, using community funds to attract builders and drive token demand through transaction fees. Of course, this was a very naive vision that could only work in a bull market, especially considering the high inflation we have.</p>

    <p> 𝐉𝐮𝐧𝐨 𝐍𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤: 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝 🧵 <p>
Juno is the most debated project in the Cosmos Ecosystem, and this thread will shed light on everything. Read till the end.  
 <p>𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 <p> 
 <p>•Unveiling the Basics 🔥 <p>
 <p>•History & mistakes 🐻 <p>
 <p>•The bright future🌱 <p>
 <p> 𝐔𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐜𝐬 🛠️ <p>
 <p>@JunoNetwork <p>
 is a permissionless smart contract network built using the Cosmos SDK and reaches network agreement via Tendermint Consensus. Thanks to the IBC, it is highly interoperable with all networks in the Cosmos ecosystem.⚡
Juno supports the deployment of contracts in multiple languages via the 
 <p>@CosmWasm <p>
 module, which comes with unique advantages compared to other popular Web3 frameworks such as: •Increased Security🛡️
•Efficiency & Performance🌊
•Interoperability & Portability🔌
Thanks to CosmWasm's superpowers, Juno prevents almost all the known risk vectors of Ethereum. DeFi hacking is an ordinary thing on EVM chains (using Solidity), but not on Juno. Juno is not only more secure but also more efficient.🔥
In short, CosmWasm allows you to use familiar, powerful, and safe languages to write highly performant and secure smart contracts. These smart contracts can be deployed to a number of different blockchains and even communicate across blockchains via IBC. 👀
 <p>𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐮𝐛𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫 ⚵  <p>
Juno is pioneering CosmWasm adoption by encouraging rapid project development and iteration, allowing involvement, and assisting projects in determining product-market fit before launching their own Mesh-Secured L1.🤝
Juno offers some amazing tools that make it a lot easier for a developer to deploy their very own dApp. While new modules and tools are constantly being developed, in this thread we will only refer to DaoDao, Komple and FeeShare!🤔
 <p>𝐃𝐀𝐎𝐃𝐀𝐎 ☯︎ <p>
DaoDao is critical to the Interchain Incubator's narrative. It enables devs to create their own governance structures, allowing them to spend less time on this and more time on their main product. Juno will soon use it for its core governance.🚢
This is a mechanism that enables developers and communities to earn Juno income passively for their contract work, without requiring additional funds from users. As usage and popularity of the application grows, so does the income.💰
Juno is a community owned and operated network. The majority of the genesis supply was airdropped to atom stakers, committed to the community pool, and to the development reserve for ongoing development of the Juno Network features.🪂
Juno has undoubtedly the 𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙨𝙩 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙢𝙪𝙣𝙞𝙩𝙮 in Cosmos and the highest participation record in a single governance proposal ever(98% turnout in the controversial proposal 16) while consistently ranking among the top chains in terms of active users!🗳️
Juno's core-team consists from talented builders of Cosmos and Web3 in general. However, 𝙖 𝙨𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙨 𝙤𝙛 𝙢𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙠𝙚𝙨  made Juno one of the most controversial networks in the cryptocurrency industry and brought it where it is now. Let's see them all one-by-one.
 <p>𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐚𝐥 𝟏𝟔 🐋 <p>
It still remains one of the most controversial proposals, even though a couple core-devs of Juno have admitted that it was a clear mistake. It all began with a whale had a more airdropped tokens than it should (max cap was 50k juno)
The ‘whale’ got around this cap by separating their ATOMs into over 50 wallets, and then consolidating them into a single wallet later. However, the whale was never a single person but a fund controlling their clients' funds!👇
This proposal split the community in half and certainly showed some big investors the exit door amid the danger of the next Whale Hunt and the fact that their suggestions were never taken seriously.📉
The proposal was not discussed on the forum before being passed on-chain (like every other proposal did and still does). It was a rushed proposal without enough research or any plans to solve the issue without harming the CCN's (whale/fund name) clients interests.😵
This was and remains the biggest mistake of core-1 until today. The good news is that most core-1 members recognize that it was a mistake and are still around to reverse the situation.☀️
 <p>𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐏𝐨𝐨𝐥 𝐖𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞🗑️ <p>
The community pool decreased by funding projects that never brought value back to Juno. The community cannot take investment decisions without guidance and this can be fixed by addressing the following problem.
 <p>𝐋𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐨𝐟 𝐜𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩👑 <p>
Core-1 consists from talented & passionate developers. However, just like every ecosystem, network or society it needs a leader. At the moment, Core-1 is individual developers expressing themselves as individuals.
Juno's mistakes so far are all deeply rooted in a lack of leadership. What if Core-1 as a team took a clear thesis during Prop16? What if they stepped in and guided the community when the community pool was wasted?👇
It's difficult to have a clear leader, and it's dubious that a core-1 dev can or wants to lead the ecosystem. However, in times of crisis, Core-1 must function collectively without fracturing the community due to the opposing viewpoints of some of its members.🌱
Juno is clearly the best L1 for deploying a complete dApp with ease. Developers are still working hard to make it a leading chain in the Cosmos Ecosystem, serving as the CosmWasm home, the DAO hub, and the interchain incubator.🔥
The great news for Juno's future, however, is that the core team appears to have learned from past major mistakes and is willing to reverse the situation by cooperating with its key investors.💎
Its advanced infrastructure, its great tokenomics, and its amazing tooling were never a problem for Juno. The fact that Core-1 recognized their mistakes and changed their attitude radically is the most bullish news about $Juno ever!💪
Last but not least, new validators appear during bear market and support the network during times of uncertainty and fear. The 
@CyberneticsOrg
 is a validator and a group of passionate professionals with the mission to provide long-term support to Juno.
